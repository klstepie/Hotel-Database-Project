# Hotel-Database-Project
The design of a relational-document database. <br/>

It's my first public project. <br/>
It represents relational-document hotel database. It contains only two main departments - reception and additional services. <br/>
I am translating it at the moment because I have implemented the whole project in my native language. <br/>
So stay tuned, it will be in English soon. <br/>
After that, I will upload more precise description here. <br/>
